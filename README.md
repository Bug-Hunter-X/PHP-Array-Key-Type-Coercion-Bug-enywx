This repository demonstrates a subtle yet common bug in PHP related to array key type coercion.  The `bug.php` file shows how assigning values to array keys that are numerically equivalent but different types (string vs integer) leads to data loss, as the latter assignment overwrites the former.  The solution, shown in `bugSolution.php`, involves stricter key handling or type checking before assigning array values to prevent this issue.
